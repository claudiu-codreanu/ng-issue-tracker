# My Angular Issue Tracker

Little app which I wrote in order to learn Angular basics. It follows Chapter 3 (Building an Issue Tracking System using Reactive Forms) of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/angular-projects-second-edition/9781800205260" target="_blank">*Angular Projects 2nd edition*</a>.

<br>

It simulates a defect tracking system, and it makes use of Clarity components and Angular reactive forms. Along the way, it teaches key patterns such as service injection, emitting events, building forms, validating inputs, etc.

<br>

The instructions in the book are clear and easy to follow. However the subject matter itself is quite challenging. Angular is verbose and complex, so the learning curve is steep.

<br>

But it was fun, and I look forward to the remaining 9 chapters!

By the way, I published the project live, using github pages. Please find it <a href="https://claudiu-codreanu.github.io/ng-issue-tracker/" target="_blank">**here**</a>.
